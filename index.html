<!-- Redirect to the OneNote notebook for this class.

     The class will have an 'edit' URL through which the class can access the
     notebook for editing.  This page will, when first set up, redirect to
     that edit URL.

     The edit URL will typically have an expiration date, after which the
     class will need to use a 'view' URL.  This page's JavaScript code will
     start redirecting to the view URL one day before the edit URL's
     expiration date.

     To account for the possibility that the JavaScript doesn't work for a
     client, an HTTP redirect is also used in the HTML header.  Similarly,
     the HTML body includes a message identifying the redirect target.

     -----
     How to use:

      1. Set up DNS and primary URL to resolve to this page.

      2. Set up the edit and view URLs.

      2. Update the variables in the comments below, the JavaScript code,
         and the HTML code.

      3. If the edit URL does have an expiration date, then remember to come
         back just ahead of the expiration date and update the hard-coded HTTP
         redirect to use the view URL.  Again, just to account for the
         possibility that the JavaScript doesn't work for a client.
